# FL21-COSC1436
Final Project for COSC1436
<hr/>
Be sure take a look at the sequence of actions that you should take to complete this lab.

The goal is for you to 
<ol>
  <li>Create a pull request to obtain access to the program.</li>
  <li>Modify the program in the least possible way to implement your functionality.
    <ol>
      <li>successfully add a function to the CollabFL21.cpp program</li>
      <li>add your function prototype</li>
      <li>and add the call to your function so that the program works successfully.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Generate a request merge your changes back into the class project.</li>
  <li>Review any feedback on your submission and make correctds/resubmit, if needed.</li>
</ol>

If your changes are accepted, they will be added to the final source code on Github and appear on any other fork that occurs from the main branch.

Start early and keep moving forward. Almost done.
